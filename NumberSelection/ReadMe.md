#  Number Selection Game
This is a console application implemented on three different languages: Ruby, Scala, and Groovy. 
The program asks the user to guess a number the computer has selected between 0 and 100. 
If the user guess is higher or lower to the actual number, let them know. 
If the user guesses the right value, print the number of attempts they took to make the right guess and quit the program.

The program should not use mutation or recursion. 

Each language directory includes build file and tests.
