# Rod Cutting Problem 
A solution to a classic dynamic programming problem implemented in two different languages: Scala and Groovy. 

Given the length of a rod (say 10"), and prices for variaos sizes of rods (price for 1'', 2'', 3'' ...). Find the maximum price we can get, either by selling the rod as is or by cutting it into various pieces.

The algorithm shall be implemented in recursion first and memoization second. Both algorithms should be timed for execution.

The program should not use mutation.

Each language directory includes build file and unit tests.
